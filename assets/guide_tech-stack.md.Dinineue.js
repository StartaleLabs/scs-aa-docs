Integrating smart accounts into your applications unlocks a wide range of wallet functionalities and modular extensions, such as social login for simplified user access and session modules that eliminate the need for users to sign on-chain activities with wallet popups repeatedly, and more, enhancing the overall user experience which are explained in later sections.</p><h2 id="bundler-api" tabindex="-1">Bundler API <a class="header-anchor" href="#bundler-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Bundler API&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Bundler is a fundamental component of the ERC-4337 infrastructure that enables account abstraction on any EVM-compatible network. Its primary role is to manage a new mempool of UserOperations (UOs) and ensure that these UOs are efficiently included on-chain.</p><p>To make on-chain activities for smart accounts, end users should submit UOs to the Bundler API rather than sending transactions directly to the blockchain node.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p><b>What is UserOperations (UOs)</b></p><p>Pseudo-transaction object called a <code>UserOperation</code> which is used to execute actions through a smart contract account.</p></div><h2 id="paymasters" tabindex="-1">Paymasters <a class="header-anchor" href="#paymasters" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Paymasters&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Paymasters are on-chain smart contracts that enable flexible gas payment mechanisms.</p><p>One of the main challenges with using EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts) is that wallet owners must acquire native token (e.g. ETH) before they can perform any on-chain actions, creating a significant hurdle for user experience. Paymasters address this issue by abstracting gas payment, allowing an Paymaster contract to cover native token gas costs on behalf of account owner.</p><p>Paymasters enable gas sponsorship, allowing dApp developers to cover transaction costs on behalf of users. They also support gas payments using ERC20 tokens, allowing account owners to pay gas fees with tokens while the paymaster covers the gas cost with the native token.</p><h2 id="paymaster-api" tabindex="-1">Paymaster API <a class="header-anchor" href="#paymaster-api" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Paymaster API&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Paymaster API is responsible for providing end users with the signature required for on-chain verification.</p><p>To have your User Operations (UOs) sponsored or token payments accepted by SCS Paymasters, you must first obtain a valid paymaster signature from the off-chain Paymaster API. Include this signature in the UO before submitting it to the Bundler. Once the signature is validated by the on-chain Paymaster smart contract, your UO becomes eligible for gas sponsorship or token payments.</p>',15)]))}const m=a(o,[["render",i]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
