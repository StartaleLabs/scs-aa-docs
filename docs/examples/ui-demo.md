# ðŸ’»Â Â UI Integration Demo

This demo showcases a decentralized dice-rolling game that utilizes smart accounts (ERC-7579) and session-based execution.
By using social login provider (Privy), and session keys, users can create a smart contract wallet and roll dice without needing to sign every transaction, enhancing UX while maintaining security.

It also features optional social recovery module functionality.

Currently, the demo utilizes Bicomomy's Nexus smart contract wallet implementation with Rhinestone's 7579 modules.

## ðŸš€ How to Use the Demo

### Prerequisites

- Either a web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) connected to the [**Soneium Minato**](https://soneium-minato.blockscout.com/) test network, a Google account, or an email address to receive the sign-in code

- The web3 wallet or social login is used to instantiate the smart contract wallet in this case. In a production environment, you might want to handle this by the service backend.
- All operations are funded by a paymaster, so no funds are needed in the wallet

### Steps

1. **Connect Your Wallet or log in**

   - Open the application and connect your web3 wallet, Google or email account

2. **Instantiate a Smart Account**

   - An account is automatically instantiated, the address is displayed in the output area

3. **(Optional) Add recovery keys**

   - Input a guardian address, and click "Add guardian".
   - On the first guardian add, the SocialRecovery module is installed first
   - You can add and remove more guardian addresses
   - A minimum of one address must be present after the module is installed

4. **Start the game**

   - Clicking the "New game" button will install the SmartSession module (only on first use), and create a session.
   - Session will be stored in local storage so the game can be played instantly on the next visit

6. **Play the Dice Game**

   - Once a session is active, roll the dice using the UI.
   - The result is written on-chain without additional signature prompts.
   - Your roll history and score are fetched directly from the smart contract.
